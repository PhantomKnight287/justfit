# JustFit

A simple application to keep track of the exercises I am doing and how long it takes me to do it. There were no apps that works in a way such that I can enter my own exercise in them with custom start and break time

I've no plans to release it(I don't wanna deal with app stores approvals and everything) and making it ios compatible(cause I've windows and apple doesn't provide xcode for windows. "Screw you apple")
